# Mount Bromo Tourism Website

# Overview
This website was created as part of the **Web Programming Midterm Project (UTS Pemrograman Web)**.  
It presents information about **Mount Bromo**, one of Indonesiaâ€™s most iconic natural attractions, including its **history**, **culture**, and **current tourism status**.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to build a functional and visually appealing website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

# Features

# Front-End Design
- Built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
- Responsive layout with modern design (cards, grid system, and overlay).
- Integrated **dark mode toggle** that remembers user preference.
- Smooth visual presentation for readability and aesthetics.

# JavaScript Functionality
All JavaScript code is **embedded directly inside the HTML files**, not in a separate `.js` file.  
It enhances interactivity and improves user experience with the following features:
1. **Dark Mode Toggle** â€” switches between light and dark themes and saves preference using `localStorage`.
2. **Image Slideshow (Home Page)** â€” automatically cycles through images every 3 seconds.
3. **Form Validation (Contact Page)** â€” checks user input before submission:
   - Ensures all fields are filled.
   - Checks email format.
   - Displays alert messages for validation feedback.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML5** â€” structure and semantic layout  
- **CSS3** â€” styling, responsive design, and animations  
- **JavaScript (inline)** â€” interactivity and validation logic  
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)** â€” modern typography
